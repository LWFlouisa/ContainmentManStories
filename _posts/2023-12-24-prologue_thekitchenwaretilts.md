There are several things you expect out of a beach house. You'll expect a private residence, therefore no people sneaking onto your beach you did not invite. Sometimes even a flood will happen. However one thing that virtually will never happen, yet did on this day, was the entire house collapsing into the ocean as the tsunami hit. A tsunami along the coast of South Carolina, greater than a chance of never, but less than the population of Earth. On this trip, only me and my aunt swam from the wreckage. The water was so deep, as it flooded the shore, that we arrived all the way to Nashville before reaching land. Will several different islands in between that final rest.

Here, in Nashville, was not a normal sky, but a movie theater screen. That would play constant reruns of the Nature Channel on a Safari. Using the latest of 3D technology, at times it looked as if you could walk into the screen, and pluck Lion cub and take them home with you. Some say the Tsunami caused a channels in engineering priorities. What I know is now, there is an entire generation that grew up never feeling real rain, with the plates overhead designed to protect the city as the land sank beneath the ocean. Above these were skyscrapers, designed with a fare amount of flex. This was where the aristocracy lived, in giant cities in the flood planes of once was once the Bible belt all the way to Louisiana. With intermittent islands that were once mountain tops.

In these underwater cities, people lived in underground houses similar to beach houses. My old neighbor Brittney, one of the people that also survived the wreckage, would not otherwise have any occasion to talk to me except for the fact that almost everyone she new had died in the flood, except for her father David. He would live in the lower house, while she would live in the upper house. The whole town lived near a mining town, that would mine for resources under the ocean. And to keep the working class from rioting, constructed a giant artificial movie theater in the sky.

People that lived above it, were able to live in such material wealth, because of the cost to maintain the facility. Yet for all knew, there were still people that lived in the mountain tops of Tennessee, a land that sank beneath the rising oceans. All the wild life that did survive gravitated to these peaks, and rescue animals would be taken from here, and off to a the landscape of Africa, in order to have more solid ground to graze on. But Grissly Bears were not used to interacting with Lions and Tigers, creating an odd family dynamic. Not unlike the interaction with estranged relatives, that somehow managed to survive the flood of the Tennessee valleys.

When all this is said and done, I'm not sure the Fundamentalist Christians knew what they were asking for. They might have claim to get swept all the way to heaven, but most people I know of that live in the sky, are some of the most corrupt people, who view us that live in the city under the ocean as their wage slavery. Everything seems like Beach Property, when you "earn" 35,000,000 dollars a year. So that must be wear the money goes that finance those big churches Fundamentalist Christians go to.

I suppose it figures. I don't think any can swim.

It would turn into a city life jackets when the theater bursts. But for me, having nobody ability to work, in a normal capacity, would find time to clean Brittney's house when she was away to tend the convenience markets. I always noted how often the house would wobble. The flood changed how things would be engineered, so nothing would ever collapse again. Beach houses being one of the few places you could count on when the sky fell. And we wouldn't ever again, live like animals on a Safari, with pathways made out for us with barbed wire fence and machine gun fire, and weapons of mass flooding in the previous war.

We will never have to ride a Tsunami again.

But only worry about the slide of kitchenware.
