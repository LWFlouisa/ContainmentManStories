Her name was evil, Eviloscense. Tears flowing like rain. Piano in the halls, for us this last dance. Ma Eviloscense. She carried a guillotine pocket watch, ma fairie, Her eyes were like distant oceans with boats crashed, Come ashore, ma Eviloscense.

From Mountains of France and hills Japan, my love is but for nobody, ms swan neck. Fragile as a porcelain ma Fairie. Ma Eviloscense. How your fragile masked a deep hurt, and a blood lust. Vulnerability flows outside eyes.

I can only enjoy your tender lips and your gentle neck under oblique looking glass, shining. Ma Eviloscense. For your neck is my obsession, and yet I want nothing of the taste of blood flowing from the swan. For you are my goose and stuffing is what I wish to be, for ma femme. Ma Eviloscense.

Eviloscense was twenty four, but one might think twenty two. Dressed conservatively, her life was work "tree hoofs", sabots shaped like deer's feet, made entirely of lumber, with a hard top and hard bottom. She would work from 3:00 A.M. to 4:00 A.M. the next morning. And yet the life of labor had only made her more fit, with eyes that could stare into your soul. Her hair the color obsidian glass, with red highlights. And at times her mood was just as fragile.

The only thing she valued in life was a portable mirror, like the evil stepmother of some fairy tales. But this was not the year of the 19th century, or even France where the guillotine persisted until 1978. Therefore the only name brands she could found, where in places whose dialect was French, rather than Os Azusacos: "Bijou De Cygne."

Women in the Os Azusacos were typically called Cygne, as a pun on seigneur. But it was only certain women whom developed the reputation of having the necks of a swan. Yet during the war, there were women who came to resent being called swans, and would murder their husbands in their sleep, dressed in all black. Their Sabots De Arbres the color of smoke and death. And everyone descended from these women where labeled as Black Swan, or Cygne Noir.

They were more likely to be executed by Guillotine Arrow, framed for crimes they didn't commit, or sent off to the armed forces, as such women had no husbands at home, and this the sensation of death was like having a husband at home waiting for them, as they drove off the Japanese Army in the Far West, near California.

Ma Eviloscense, was not evil by choice of action, or by inaction. But simply do to the circumstances of her birth, having a solider mother, who had previously murdered her husband, and serving the emerging nation of Os Azusacos, could serve as a substitute for public decapitation by Biyoboruto, a guillotine blade shaped arrow had that constantly cut at an angle, refined from the Berger Guillotine, and four bladed. With the assumption the bolt would rotate before impact.

Ma Eviloscense would keep one of the blades that murdered her mother to remember her by, when she found her holding the three color flag with a red circle in the center, And this is what became her pocket watch. And it is for you, ma Eviloscense, that I send this letter: wait for me by the fountain, where it always shined under the glow of two moons. For the in the sky I shall fly down from an umbrella, and take care of you.

I cannot change what happened to your mother on the battlefield, but I promise I can give you, what society took away, being born under the curse of the black swan. Ma Eviloscense.
